  // mutex - which can once more reach this code in a nested call. To avoid

  // _emscripten_main_thread_futex at a time), unmark ourselves before calling
  // the potentially-recursive call. See below for how we handle the case of our

    // Check the value, as if we were starting the futex all over again.
    // This handles the following case:
    //
    //  * wait on futex A
    //  * recurse into _emscripten_yield(),
    //    which waits on futex B. that sets the _emscripten_main_thread_futex
    //    address to futex B, and there is no longer any mention of futex A.
    //  * a worker is done with futex A. it checks _emscripten_main_thread_futex
    //    but does not see A, so it does nothing special for the main thread.
    //  * a worker is done with futex B. it flips mainThreadMutex from B
    //    to 0, ending the wait on futex B.
    //  * we return to the wait on futex A. _emscripten_main_thread_futex is 0,
    //    but that is because of futex B being done - we can't tell from
    //    _emscripten_main_thread_futex whether A is done or not. therefore,
    //    check the memory value of the futex.
    //
    // That case motivates the design here. Given that, checking the memory
    // address is also necessary for other reasons: we unset and re-set our
    // address in _emscripten_main_thread_futex around calls to
    // _emscripten_yield(), and a worker could
    // attempt to wake us up right before/after such times.
    //
    // Note that checking the memory value of the futex is valid to do: we
    // could easily have been delayed (relative to the worker holding on
    // to futex A), which means we could be starting all of our work at the
    // later time when there is no need to block. The only "odd" thing is
    // that we may have caused side effects in that "delay" time. But the
    // only side effects we can have are to call
    // _emscripten_yield(). That is always ok to
    // do on the main thread (it's why it is ok for us to call it in the
    // middle of this function, and elsewhere). So if we check the value
    // here and return, it's the same is if what happened on the main thread
    // was the same as calling _emscripten_yield()
    // a few times before calling emscripten_futex_wait().
